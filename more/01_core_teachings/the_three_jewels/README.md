## [The Three Jewels (Triple Gem) — *Ti-ratana*](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#the-three-jewels-triple-gem--ti-ratana)

In classical Buddhist teaching, **taking refuge** in the Three Jewels is not a pledge of belief but a **practical orientation of life**—a commitment to wake up to reality as it is, and to live accordingly. Refuge means *“that which protects from [suffering](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/2_the_four_noble_truths/README.md#1-there-is-suffering--dukkha)”* (Pāli: *saraṇa*).

## [1) **Buddha** — the Awakened One, and awakening itself](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#1-buddha--the-awakened-one-and-awakening-itself)


Historically, the Buddha refers to **Siddhārtha Gautama**, who realized liberation through direct insight into the nature of mind and reality.

Doctrinally, **Buddha** has three inseparable meanings:

1. **The historical Buddha** — proof that [awakening](../../10_concepts/README.md#3-enlightenment-bodhi-awakening) is humanly possible.
2. **Buddhahood** — the *state of awakening*: complete freedom from ignorance (*avijjā*), craving (*taṇhā*), and suffering (*dukkha*).
3. [**Buddha-nature**](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/6_buddha_nature/README.md#buddha-nature-tathāgatagarbha--explained-through-buddhist-teachings) (emphasized in [Mahāyāna](../../05_yanas/README.md#limitation-from-mahāyāna-view)) — the *capacity for awakening inherent in all beings*.

> Taking refuge in Buddha means trusting **awakening over habit**, [wisdom](../the_noble_eightfold_path/README.md#1-wisdom-paññā) over impulse.

## [2) **Dharma** — the path and the law of reality](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#2-dharma--the-path-and-the-law-of-reality)


**Dharma (Dhamma)** operates on two levels simultaneously:

### a) **Teachings**

* The [Four Noble Truths](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/2_the_four_noble_truths/README.md#the-four-noble-truths--as-the-buddha-meant-them)
* The [Noble Eightfold Path](../the_noble_eightfold_path/README.md#what-the-noble-eightfold-path-is-in-buddhism)
* [Dependent Origination (*paṭicca-samuppāda*)](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/3_dependent_origination/README.md#the-twelve-links-the-classic-formulation)
* [Impermanence (*anicca*)](../impermanence/README.md#2-impermanence-anicca-is-structural-not-accidental), [non-self (*anattā*)](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/1_the_three_marks_of_existence/README.md#3-non-self-anattā), unsatisfactoriness (*dukkha*)

These are **diagnostic and therapeutic**, not metaphysical doctrines.

### b) **Reality itself**

Dharma also means *“the way things actually are”*:

* phenomena arise due to causes and conditions,
* nothing permanent or independent can be found,
* clinging inevitably produces suffering.

Crucially, the Buddha taught:

> **Dharma is to be realized, not believed.**

The teachings are compared to a **raft**—essential for crossing the river, but not to be carried once the crossing is complete.

## [3) **Sangha** — the living continuity of awakening](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#3-sangha--the-living-continuity-of-awakening)


Traditionally, **Sangha** means the community of ordained monks and nuns who preserve the teachings and discipline (*Vinaya*).

In broader and deeper senses:

1. **Practical Sangha** — all sincere practitioners who support one another in ethical living, [meditation](../../08_lineage/README.md), and wisdom.
2. **Noble Sangha** — those who have directly realized stages of awakening (stream-enterers and beyond).
3. **Relational Sangha** — the *field of awakened relationship* in which insight is sustained through dialogue, example, correction, and [compassion](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/7_compassion/README.md#compassion-as-a-structural-principle-in-buddhist-teaching).

The Buddha repeatedly emphasized that **isolation weakens practice**, while wise companionship (*kalyāṇa-mittatā*) accelerates liberation.

## [Functional Unity of the Three Jewels](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#functional-unity-of-the-three-jewels)


The [Three Jewels](#the-three-jewels-triple-gem---ti-ratana) are not separate objects but **one integrated system**:

| Jewel      | Function in Practice                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Buddha** | The **possibility** and living proof |
| [**Dharma**](#2-dharma---the-path-and-the-law-of-reality) | The **method** and truth             |
| **Sangha** | The **supporting conditions**        |

Remove one, and practice collapses:

* Without Buddha → no confidence in awakening.
* Without Dharma → no direction.
* Without Sangha → no stability or correction.

## [Refuge as an ongoing practice](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#refuge-as-an-ongoing-practice)


In early texts, refuge is taken **three times**, symbolizing:

* body, speech, and mind,
* past, present, and future,
* understanding, practice, and realization.

But refuge is not a single event. It deepens as:

* confidence becomes insight,
* [ethics](../the_noble_eightfold_path/README.md#2-ethical-conduct-śīla) becomes spontaneous,
* effort becomes natural.

> Ultimately, taking refuge in the Three Jewels means **becoming them**:
> awakening as Buddha, clarity as Dharma, and compassion as Sangha.
