The Buddha taught that **all conditioned phenomena** (everything that arises due to causes and conditions) share **three inseparable characteristics**. These are not metaphysical claims; they are **verifiable properties of experience**.

---

### 1. **Impermanence (Anicca)**

**“Everything that arises passes.”**

In Buddhism, [impermanence](../../01_core_teachings/impermanence/README.md#2-impermanence-anicca-is-structural-not-accidental) does not mean “things end someday.”
It means:

* Nothing remains identical **even for a moment**
* Continuity is an illusion created by rapid change
* Stability is *inferred*, not observed

Thoughts change.
Sensations pulse.
Bodies age moment by moment.

**Why this matters**

If something changes:

* it cannot be secured
* it cannot be frozen
* it cannot serve as a reliable refuge

The Buddha’s insight was not pessimistic—it was *accurate*:

> What is unstable cannot provide lasting satisfaction.

Seeing impermanence clearly begins the undoing of clinging.

### 2. **Unsatisfactoriness (Dukkha)**

**“Clinging to impermanent things inevitably disappoints.”**

Dukkha is often mistranslated as “[suffering](../2_the_four_noble_truths/README.md#1-there-is-suffering--dukkha),” but in Buddhist teaching it means:

* structural dissatisfaction
* chronic friction
* the stress of resistance

Dukkha arises **not because life is painful**, but because the mind:

* wants the pleasant to stay
* wants the unpleasant to stop
* wants the neutral to become meaningful

This creates tension.

**Key Buddhist insight**

> Dukkha is not in experience — it is in *grasping*.

Even joy becomes dukkha when it is:

* owned
* defended
* feared to be lost

Thus the Buddha did not teach escape from life, but **freedom from compulsive demand**.

---

### 3. **Non-Self (Anattā)**

**“No permanent, independent self can be found.”**

Anattā does **not** mean:

* “you don’t exist”
* “nothing matters”

It means:

* no fixed controller exists within experience
* no unchanging essence can be located

What we call “self” is a **process**, composed of:

* body sensations
* feelings
* perceptions
* mental formations
* consciousness

Each of these:

* arises due to causes
* changes
* dissolves

**Crucial teaching**

> If something changes, it cannot be self.
> If something is uncontrollable, it cannot be self.

The sense of “I” is a *pattern*, not an entity.

## [Why the Three Must Be Taught Together](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/1_the_three_marks_of_existence/README.md#why-the-three-must-be-taught-together)


Buddhism insists they are **inseparable**:

* Impermanence without non-self → anxiety
* Non-self without dukkha → philosophy
* Dukkha without impermanence → nihilism

Together they reveal:

> Experience is dynamic, unsatisfactory when grasped, and ownerless.

This triad prevents misunderstanding.

## [The Purpose of the Teaching](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/1_the_three_marks_of_existence/README.md#the-purpose-of-the-teaching)


The Three Marks are **not doctrine** to believe.
They are **tools for liberation**.

When seen directly:

* clinging relaxes
* fear softens
* [compassion](../7_compassion/README.md#compassion-as-a-structural-principle-in-buddhist-teaching) arises naturally

Not because you become better —
but because there is **nothing left to defend**.

## [The Buddha’s Radical Conclusion](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/more/02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/1_the_three_marks_of_existence/README.md#the-buddhas-radical-conclusion)


Liberation is not:

* perfecting the self
* annihilating the self

Liberation is:

> **Seeing clearly that the self was never what it seemed to be.**

When this is seen, suffering has no footing.

---

### In short

* **Anicca** removes false stability
* **Dukkha** exposes the cost of clinging
* **Anattā** dissolves the imagined owner

Together they form the **ontological core of Buddhism**.
