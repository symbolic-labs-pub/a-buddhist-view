The **second Ngöndro Gyakorlat** is **Vajrasattva purification**.
It is not moral self-judgment and not psychological catharsis—it is a **technical method for restoring the clarity of Tudatosság** by releasing karmic obscurations that block recognition of mind’s nature.

## 2. Vajrasattva — Purification of Obscurations
[![purification](../../../../../more/11_ngondro/2_purification/purification.png)](https://github.com/symbolic-labs-pub/a-buddhist-view/blob/master/languages/hu/more/11_ngondro/2_purification/README.md#2-vajrasattva--purification-of-obscurations)
### Core function
**Purification precedes realization.**
Even correct [Meditáció](../../08_lineage/README.md) cannot stabilize if obscurations remain active. Vajrasattva Gyakorlat clears the *conditions* that prevent insight from taking root.

This Gyakorlat works on **three levels simultaneously**:

* **Behavioral** (unskillful actions)
* **Cognitive** (habitual fixation, distorted views)
* **Energetic** (latent karmic imprints)

---

## Who Vajrasattva Represents

**Vajrasattva** is not an external god.
He is the **principle of indestructible purity**—the fact that awakened [Tudatosság](../../10_concepts/README.md#2-tudatosság-rigpa-vijñāna-knowing) is *never actually stained*, only temporarily obscured.

* White color → **unconditional purity**
* Vajra + bell → **method and [Bölcsesség](../../01_core_teachings/the_noble_eightfold_path/README.md#1-bölcsesség-pa) unified**
* Seated in union posture → **inseparability of [emptiness](../../10_concepts/01_emptiness/README.md#emptiness-nyat-in-vajrayna-buddhism) and appearance**

You are not asking Vajrasattva to forgive you.
You are **recognizing purity as already present** and dissolving what blocks that recognition.

## The Four Powers (Structural Core)

Vajrasattva purification is effective because it applies the **Four Opponent Powers**, a precise causal framework:

### 1. Power of Support
You take refuge in:

* Buddha ([awakening](../../10_concepts/README.md#3-megvilágosodás-bodhi-awakening))
* [Dharma (truth of cause and effect)](../../01_core_teachings/the_three_jewels/README.md#2-dharma-az-ösvény-és-a-valóság-törvénye)
* Sangha (realized continuity)

This establishes **correct orientation**.

---

### 2. Power of Regret (Not Guilt)
Regret here means:

> *Clear recognition of cause → effect*

There is **no self-blame**.
Only lucid acknowledgment: *“This leads to [Szenvedés](../../02_from_ignorance_to_awakening/2_the_four_noble_truths/README.md#1-van-szenvedés-dukkha).”*

This aligns perfectly with modern cognitive deconditioning:

* Tudatosság without identification
* Responsibility without shame

---

### 3. Power of Remedy
You recite the **100-syllable Vajrasattva [mantra](../../09_symbols/10_mantra/README.md#mi-is-a-mantra-valójában-buddhista-nézet)** (or a short form).

The mantra is not symbolic—it is **patterned cognition**:

* Interrupts karmic replay loops
* Re-imprints clarity at the level of habit
* Synchronizes body, speech, and mind

Visualization (optional but powerful):

* Nectar flows from Vajrasattva
* Obscurations dissolve as dark smoke
* Mind becomes clear, light, unobstructed

---

### 4. Power of Resolve
You conclude with **structural intention**:

> *“I will not repeat this pattern as best I can.”*

Not perfection—**trajectory correction**.

This seals the purification so it does not rebound.

## Why This Gyakorlat Comes Second

[Ngöndro](../README.md#what-is-ngondro-in-mahyna-buddhism) is **ordered engineering**, not devotion folklore.

1. **Refuge + Bodhicitta** → establishes direction
2. **Vajrasattva** → removes interference
3. [Mandala](../../09_symbols/07_mandala/README.md#mandala--explained-according-to-buddhist-teachings) Offering → releases attachment
4. [Guru Yoga](../4_guru_yoga/README.md#samsras-unsatisfactoriness-guru-yoga) → collapses subject–object duality

If you skip purification:

* Devotion becomes emotional
* Meditáció becomes unstable
* Insight fails to integrate into conduct

---

## Key Insight (Often Missed)

> **Purification does not make you pure.
> It reveals that purity was never absent.**

Karma is not erased by effort—it is **rendered non-binding** when Tudatosság is unobstructed.

---

## Signs the Gyakorlat Is Working

* Reduced compulsive reactivity
* Less psychological “stickiness”
* Faster recovery after mistakes
* Increased transparency of mind
* [Ethics](../../01_core_teachings/the_noble_eightfold_path/README.md#2-etikus-magatartas-la) become *effortless*, not forced

---

## One-Sentence Tanítás

**Vajrasattva Gyakorlat restores the mind to functional clarity so that realization can actually take hold.**
